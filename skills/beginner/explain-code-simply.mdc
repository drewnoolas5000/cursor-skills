# Explain Code Simply

## Overview

This skill helps explain code in plain, non-technical language. Perfect for explaining code to:
- Non-engineering stakeholders
- New team members unfamiliar with the domain
- Yourself when you need a fresh perspective

## When to Use

- Preparing to explain a feature to product managers
- Writing documentation for non-technical users
- Understanding legacy code at a high level
- Onboarding new team members

## Guidelines

When asked to explain code:

### Step 1: Identify the Purpose

Start with what the code DOES, not how it does it.
- What problem does it solve?
- What would happen if this code didn't exist?

### Step 2: Use Everyday Analogies

Connect technical concepts to familiar experiences:
- Database → Filing cabinet
- API → Waiter taking your order
- Loop → Checking each item in a grocery bag
- Conditional → Fork in the road

### Step 3: Avoid Jargon

If you must use a technical term:
1. Use the simple word first
2. Add the technical term in parentheses
3. Never assume knowledge of programming concepts

### Step 4: Keep It Brief

- 2-3 short paragraphs maximum
- One main idea per paragraph
- End with the "so what" — why this matters

## Examples

### Example 1: Ruby Method

**User asks:** "What does this method do?"

```ruby
def calculate_overtime(hours)
  return 0 if hours <= 40
  (hours - 40) * 1.5
end
```

**Good response:**

"This code figures out overtime pay. Here's the rule: if someone works 40 hours or less, they get zero overtime. But for every hour beyond 40, it counts as 1.5 hours (that's time-and-a-half).

So if someone works 45 hours, the code calculates: 5 extra hours × 1.5 = 7.5 overtime units. The payroll system then multiplies this by their hourly rate."

### Example 2: Database Query

**User asks:** "What is this SQL doing?"

```sql
SELECT company_name, COUNT(*) as employee_count
FROM companies
JOIN employees ON companies.id = employees.company_id
WHERE employees.status = 'active'
GROUP BY company_name
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100;
```

**Good response:**

"This is like asking: 'Show me all companies that have more than 100 active employees, and tell me exactly how many each one has.'

Imagine you have two filing cabinets — one for companies and one for employees. This code looks through both, counts how many active employees belong to each company, and only shows you the big companies (100+ employees).

This might be used for identifying which companies need enterprise-level support, or for billing purposes."

### Example 3: React Component

**User asks:** "What does this component do?"

```jsx
const PayrollStatus = ({ payroll }) => {
  if (payroll.status === 'processing') {
    return <Spinner />;
  }
  return <Badge status={payroll.status}>{payroll.status}</Badge>;
};
```

**Good response:**

"This is the little status indicator you see next to each payroll. It works like a traffic light:

- If the payroll is still being processed, it shows a spinning animation (like a loading wheel)
- Once it's done, it shows a colored badge with the status (like 'Complete' or 'Failed')

This helps users know at a glance whether they need to wait or take action."

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- ❌ "The function iterates over the array using a map callback"
- ✅ "The code looks at each item in the list, one by one"

- ❌ "It returns early if the condition is falsy"
- ✅ "It stops immediately if there's nothing to do"

- ❌ Starting with implementation details
- ✅ Starting with the purpose and end result

## Tips for Different Audiences

| Audience | Focus On | Avoid |
|----------|----------|-------|
| Product Manager | Business impact, user experience | Technical implementation |
| Designer | What users see/interact with | Backend logic |
| Support Team | How it affects customers | Code structure |
| New Engineer | Patterns and conventions | Deep optimization details |
